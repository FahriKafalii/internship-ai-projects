# CNN for Malaria Detection

A deep learning project that uses a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) to classify malaria cell images.

## What it does
- Processes microscopy cell images
- Trains a CNN model for binary classification
- Evaluates model performance on validation data

## Tech stack
- Python
- TensorFlow / Keras
- NumPy
- Jupyter Notebook

## How to run
1. Create a virtual environment
2. Install required libraries
3. Download the malaria dataset separately
4. Run the notebook(s) in this folder

## Notes
- Dataset and trained model files are excluded due to size limitations.
- This project focuses on demonstrating CNN-based image classification.
